# Python
Just things I have done in Python. Mostly to show that I am familiar with Python.

## On the issue of dates
The file dates are incorrect in the CodeWars. I have been keeping the files in a separate repository because I accidentally made an organization account rather than an individual account, so I moved the files manually. Everything in the CodeWars file is at least 4 months old.
